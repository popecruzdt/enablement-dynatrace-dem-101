Dynatrace Synthetic Monitoring makes it easy for you to monitor the availability and performance of your applications as experienced by your customers around the world and around the clock. Availability is the success rate at a given instant or time period that indicates if your application is fully functional and available to users. Performance measures whether your web page or recorded interaction experiences significant slowdowns compared to a threshold.

The availability and performance of your internal resources are equally important. With the ability to execute monitors from private locations, you can bring the testing capabilities available in public locations right to your own infrastructure.

Synthetic monitoring is about proactively simulating user visits, regardless of whether or not real users are currently visiting your site. Dynatrace Synthetic Monitoring provides you with 24x7 global visibility into your applications. An HTTP monitor uses simple HTTP requests. A browser monitor involves much moreâ€”it drives real web browser sessions with full HTML5/AJAX support.

Dynatrace offers these types of synthetic monitors: single-URL browser monitors, browser clickpaths, HTTP monitors and NAM monitors.
