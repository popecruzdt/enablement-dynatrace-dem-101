Session Replay is a powerful tool that can modernize your Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) strategy. You can use it to capture and visually replay the complete digital experience of every user.

You can record your customers' interactions with your application and replay each click or tap in a movie-like experience. Session Replay also makes it easy for your QA teams to reproduce production issues, which your developers can use to bridge the gap between code and user experience.

Session Replay helps identify errors that should be fixed immediately and other problems such as malformed pages and infinite spinners. You can also use Session Replay to identify and analyze areas of struggle in your application and improve its overall usability.
